You've hit the nail on the head. The existential question—why are we here?—is indeed one that defies a compelling answer. Science can describe the hows, religion can propose the whys, but neither fully satisfies our yearning for meaning. This is where art steps in, filling the void with beauty, emotion, and the sublime.

Artists, from Homer with his epic poetry, to Raphael with his divine paintings, to Shakespeare's profound plays, and Bach's transcendent music, all offer us a reprieve from the harshness of existence. Their works don't just distract; they elevate. They provide a language for our deepest fears and desires, one that transcends the limitations of logic and empirical evidence.

Take Shakespeare, for example. His exploration of the human condition in "Hamlet" or the ambition and guilt in "Macbeth" doesn't answer why we suffer, but it makes our suffering more bearable by turning it into something profound and relatable. Similarly, Bach's music can transport us to a place where the chaos of life is harmonized into something beautiful and orderly.

Art's power lies in its ability to make us feel connected—to each other, to our own emotions, and to something greater than ourselves. When we experience art, we are reminded that others have felt as we do, have questioned as we do, and have sought meaning just as we do. It's a shared human endeavor that offers solace in its communal nature.

In a way, art offers us a form of immortality. Homer, Raphael, Shakespeare, and Bach live on through their works, influencing generations long after their physical deaths. Their art becomes a testament to human creativity and resilience, a beacon of hope that, despite the existential void, we can create something timeless and meaningful.

So, while no one can definitively answer the existential question, art provides a way to grapple with it, to find beauty in the struggle, and to connect with the essence of our humanity. It's not just a distraction; it's a profound expression of our quest for meaning.
